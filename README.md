# Overview
This package is a example of using Cisco's Network Service Orchestrator (NSO), and Elastic Services Controller (ESC) to control Virtual Network Functions (VNF) running in a VMWare Infrastructure.  In this example Cisco's Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) next generation firewall can be instantiated with scaling parameters and simply policies applied with a simple user API provided by an NSO custom service.  Some of the NSO/ESC/VNF lifecycle features employed are:
  * ESC for VNF monitoring and scaling
  * NSO NFVO Core Function Pack for managing the interactions with and notifications from ESC
  * NSO service monitoring with NSO plans
  * NSO reactive-re-deploy of services for proper orchestration between VNF lifecycle events
  * NSO resource facing service (vnf-manager)
  * NSO customer facing service (firewall/ftdv-ngfw-advanced)

In this example we are using the number of users configured in the FTD as the scaling metric.  To use something different alter the
ftdload.py script.

# INSTALL / USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

### Requirements (minimum versions)
NSO version: 4.7.2
NSO NFVO package version: 3.7.0
ESC version: 4.3.0.121

### 1. Deploy ESC

### 2. Copy the following from service package to ESC
```
/src/esc-config/ftdapicheck.py
/src/esc-config/ftdload.py
/src/esc-config/metrics.xml
```

### 3. Execute the following from the directory on ESC where the files have been copied
```
sudo cp ftdapicheck.py /opt/cisco/esc/esc-scripts/ftdapicheck.py
sudo cp ftdload.py /opt/cisco/esc/esc-scripts/ftdload.py
sudo chmod a+x /opt/cisco/esc/esc-scripts/ftdapicheck.py
sudo chmod a+x /opt/cisco/esc/esc-scripts/ftdload.py
```
These have to be executed from ESC (API is only available locally)
```
curl -X DELETE -u admin:Cisco123 http://127.0.0.1:8080/ESCManager/internal/dynamic_mapping/metrics/FTD_API_PING ## It is ok if this errors as it doesn't exist yets
curl -X DELETE -u admin:Cisco123 http://127.0.0.1:8080/ESCManager/internal/dynamic_mapping/metrics/FTD_LOAD ## It is ok if this errors as it doesn't exist yets
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: Application/xml" -d @metrics.xml -u admin:Cisco123 http://127.0.0.1:8080/ESCManager/internal/dynamic_mapping/metrics
```
Check to see that metric is loaded
```
curl -u admin:Cisco123 http://127.0.0.1:8080/ESCManager/internal/dynamic_mapping/metrics | python -c 'import sys;import xml.dom.minidom;s=sys.stdin.read();print(xml.dom.minidom.parseString(s).toprettyxml())'
```

### 4. On NSO machine, Add the following entries to ncs.conf
```
<ncs-config>
  <!-- Needed by NFVO -->
  <commit-retry-timeout>infinity</commit-retry-timeout>
  <!-- Needed to see NSO kickers -->
  <hide-group>
    <name>debug</name>
  </hide-group>
/ncs-config>
```

### 5. On NSO machine, clone and make the service package where $NSO_PROJECT_DIR is the directory where your ncs.conf file is
```
cd $NSO_PROJECT_DIR/packages
git clone https://github.com/johannemitzcisco/ftdv-ngfw
cd $NSO_PROJECT_DIR/packages/ftdv-ngfw/src
make clean all
```

### 6. Start and stop NSO to pick up ncs.conf changes and the new packages
[root@nso]# ncs --stop
[root@nso]# ncs

### 7. In NSO, Register ESC device with name "ESC"

### 8. In NSO, add the following:
```
<config xmlns="http://tail-f.com/ns/config/1.0">
  <nfvo xmlns="http://tail-f.com/pkg/tailf-etsi-rel2-nfvo">
  <settings-esc xmlns="http://tail-f.com/pkg/tailf-etsi-rel2-nfvo-esc">
    <netconf-subscription>
      <username>admin</username>
      <esc-device>
        <name>ESC</name>
      </esc-device>
    </netconf-subscription>
  </settings-esc>
  </nfvo>
</config>
```

### 10. Confirm that there is a VNFD registered with NFVO (if not, load merge the all files in src/loaddata)
Note that this is the location to bound the scaling count.  In this example the minimum is 1 and the maximum
is 2.  Adjust as needed
```
admin@ncs% show nfvo vnfd | display-level 1
vnfd Cisco-FTD;
```
### 11. Load following to populate the vnf-catalog
`admin@ncs% load merge $NSO_PROJECT_DIR/packages/ftdv-ngfw/test/vnf-catalog.xml`

# USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
### 12. Site information needs to be poplated in the model see $NSO_PROJECT_DIR/packages/ftdv-ngfw/test/site.xml for sample load file
`Note that the 'admin' tenant must exist in the site data`

There are 2 ways to make VNFs spin up and down.

### 1. Populate the RFS service directly
Load or enter the following for example:
```
<config xmlns="http://tail-f.com/ns/config/1.0">
  <vnf-manager xmlns="http://example.com/ftdv-ngfw">
  <site>
    <name>CTO-LAB</name>
      <vnf-deployment>
        <tenant>admin</tenant>
        <deployment-name>ADVFTD</deployment-name>
        <catalog-vnf refcounter="1" >FTD</catalog-vnf>
        <scaling>
          <scale-up-threshold>2</scale-up-threshold>
          <scale-down-threshold>2</scale-down-threshold>
        </scaling>
      </vnf-deployment>
  </site>
  </vnf-manager>
</config>
```

  1. Check the status of the deployment in the vnf-manager and NFVO operation data.  Once the vnf-manager self components status is 'ready' the deployment is complete
```
admin@ncs> show vnf-manager 
admin@ncs> show nfvo 
```

  2. Add users to the device either manually by logging into the device or using the following helper action
```
admin@ncs> request vnf-manager site CTO-LAB vnf-deployment admin ADVFTD device admin-ADVFTD-ADVFTD-VMWARE-ESC-1 add-user username test password Test!123
```

  3. Check the status of the deployment in the vnf-manager and NFVO operation data.
```
admin@ncs> show vnf-manager 
admin@ncs> show nfvo 
```

  4. Remove users to the device either manually by logging into the device or using the following helper action
```
admin@ncs> request vnf-manager site CTO-LAB vnf-deployment admin ADVFTD device admin-ADVFTD-ADVFTD-VMWARE-ESC-1 delete-user username test
```

### 2. Populate the CFS service
Load or enter the following for example:
```
<config xmlns="http://tail-f.com/ns/config/1.0">
  <firewall xmlns="http://example.com/ftdv-ngfw">
  <ftdv-ngfw-advanced>
    <site>CTO-LAB</site>
    <tenant>admin</tenant>
    <deployment-name>ADVFTD</deployment-name>
    <catalog-vnf>FTD</catalog-vnf>
    <scaling>
      <scale-up-threshold>2</scale-up-threshold>
      <scale-down-threshold>2</scale-down-threshold>
    </scaling>
    <access-rule>
      <name>TEST</name>
      <source-zone>inside_zone</source-zone>
      <source-port>HTTPS</source-port>
      <action>PERMIT</action>
    </access-rule>
  </ftdv-ngfw-advanced>
  </firewall>
```

  1. Check the status of the deployment in the service, vnf-manager and NFVO operation data.  Once the vnf-manager self components status is 'ready' the deployment is complete
```
admin@ncs> show firewall ftdv-ngfw-advanced 
admin@ncs> show vnf-manager 
admin@ncs> show nfvo 
```

  2. Add users to the device either manually by logging into the device or using the following helper action
```
admin@ncs> request vnf-manager site CTO-LAB vnf-deployment admin ADVFTD device admin-ADVFTD-ADVFTD-VMWARE-ESC-1 add-user username test password Test!123
```

  3. Check the status of the deployment in the vnf-manager and NFVO operation data.
```
admin@ncs> show firewall ftdv-ngfw-advanced 
admin@ncs> show vnf-manager 
admin@ncs> show nfvo 
```

  4. Remove users to the device either manually by logging into the device or using the following helper action
```
admin@ncs> request vnf-manager site CTO-LAB vnf-deployment admin ADVFTD device admin-ADVFTD-ADVFTD-VMWARE-ESC-1 delete-user username test
```
